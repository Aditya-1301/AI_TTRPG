I am interested in the setting of the popular video game dredge. It is a lovecraftian horror style fishing game set in a small fishing town with the protagonist being a fisherman who ends up here after bad weather makes him crash his boat near an old lighthouse. He gets a small boat loaned to him by the mayor as the original broke in the crash and now he makes a living by catching fish in the marrows (the small town) and the neighboring fishing colonies (Gale Cliffs, Twisted Strand, Devil's Spine and Stellar Basin). On his trips sometimes the protagonist finds abberated fish which fetch him more money. The fish might be more grotesque with twisted teeth, more apendages, or more eyes. These catch the interest of the fish shop owners and they are willing to pay more for these. The fisher man can find different fish in the night and in specific areas between cliffs and rocks. However it is dangerous to fish in the night. The boat is old and needs upgrades before the fisher man can go and explore further. The night brings about weird phenomenon where it becomes harder to see far for the fisherman especially as he goes further from his starting location and he grows more and more paranoid. Depending on how late at night it is this can be quite dangerous as strange creatures from the depths can become hostile towards the fisherman and rock his boat. The unclear vision could make the fisher crash his boat into rocks which could make his boat slower or make him lose some of the fish he caught. The fisher man sometimes also find lost artefacts and meets natives of these small islands. Most of the towns are in decline with the natives being quite terrified of the things which lie beneath the sea and come out during the night. The leviathan lurks beneath the surface and is a thing of legend to the townfolk. One of the previous mayor who came in contact with one of these creatures went mad and went missing some years ago. There is a melancholic tone to most people living in these islands. The marrows is the starting location which is the safest followed by gale creak. The other locations are more and more bizzarre with each location having a unique creature lurking beneath the surface such as a kraken, or a abberated narwhale or a giant eel in the Twisted Strand region which is the mangrove area. The Devil's spine has an active volcano and some ancient ruins. Stellar basin has a massive kraken at the centre of it. It used to be a bustling tourist spot before the kraken destroyed the town there. There is also a research facility there trying to study the marine life there. In Gale Cliffs is a old whaling town where the fisher can buy explosives and harpoons. The explosives can be used to blow up closed paths and harpoons can be used to fight larger fish which poses a threat to the sailor's vessel.
