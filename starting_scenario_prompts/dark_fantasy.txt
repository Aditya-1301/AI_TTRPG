# **Dark Fantasy Setting (Berserk Ã— Game of Thrones Universe)**

**World Title:** *The Sundered Throne*

**Core Concept:** A brutal, low-magic world of unforgiving realism, defined by the weight of its own bloody history. Here, political ambition is the most dangerous weapon, old gods sleep fitfully beneath the earth, and the line between a hero and a monster is written by the victor.

**The World:**
The Kingdom of Valoria is a corpse bleeding out. Fifty years ago, the last dragon was slain, and the Targaryen-esque bloodline of the Dragon Kings ended, plunging the realm into a relentless series of civil wars known as the "Succession Scourge." Now, the land is a fractured patchwork of duchies and petty kingdoms, each ruled by a noble house nursing generations-old grudges. The roads are prowled by bandits and broken soldiers, and the common folk live in fear, their faith in both kings and gods shattered. The world feels weary, stained, and ancient. Castles are grim, functional fortresses, not fairytale spires, and every forest is rumored to be a place of dark power and forgotten evils.

**Key Regions & Landmarks for Scenario Generation:**
*   **The Dragon's Maw:** The colossal, skeletal remains of the last dragon, its ribcage forming a natural, cavernous pass through the central mountains. It is a place of pilgrimage, a bandit stronghold, and is rumored to be haunted by the echoes of the dragon's death scream.
*   **The Iron Citadel:** The former royal capital, now a grim, contested city ruled by a council of squabbling merchants and guild masters. Its massive walls are scarred from countless sieges, and its catacombs are a city-spanning network used by spies, smugglers, and heretical cults.
*   **The Weeping Marches:** A vast, cursed swamp on the kingdom's border. It is home to mutated creatures, forgotten ruins from a pre-human era, and clans of ostracized "Marsh-folk" who practice strange rites. Armies that enter the Marches rarely return.
*   **The Isle of Whispers:** A remote island that houses the "Scholars of the Eclipse," an order of historians and astrologers who obsessively chronicle the kingdom's history. They are politically neutral but are rumored to possess forbidden knowledge and prophecies concerning the return of a "branded king."

**Factions & Tensions:**
*   **The Great Houses (e.g., House Blackwood, House Falke):** The primary political players. Each has a distinct military strength (heavy infantry, skilled archers), a unique resource (iron mines, fertile farmland), and a deep-seated hatred for at least one other house.
*   **The Iron Church:** A militant, monotheistic religion that rose after the dragons' fall. It preaches that magic and old bloodlines are a sin and seeks to unify the kingdom under its own austere, theocratic rule through its order of Witch Hunters.
*   **The Sellsword Companies:** With near-constant warfare, mercenary companies like the "Crimson Gryphons" or the "Company of the Coin" have become powerful political entities in their own right. Their loyalty is always for sale, making them dangerous wild cards in any conflict.

**Unique Phenomenon:**
*   **The Eclipse & The Brand:** Every few decades, a solar eclipse plunges the world into an unnatural darkness. Those born during this time are often viewed with suspicion. Legends speak of a "Brand of Sacrifice" that can appear on certain individuals, marking them as players in a much larger, cosmic struggle between unseen forces, drawing apostles and demonic entities to them.
